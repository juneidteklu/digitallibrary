# Digital Resource Library

## The purpose of this website is so you can have a single place to store the websites, courses, videos, and books you would like to revisit in the future. 

The idea for this project came to me out of frustration. I have a wide variety of interests which means many notes in my phone that hold lists of books, courses, websites, or artists that I would like to revisit. Not to mention the many bookmarks I have on my computer. Having all of these lists scattered all over the place makes it hard for me to find what I'm looking for. I wanted a place to store all of these resources in an organized manner, and thus this website was born! A lot of what I want to achieve for this project is out of reach with my current knowledge but I'm learning more every week and will update this website as I learn. 

Goals for this website:

* User authentication 
* The ability to save as changes are made
* Allows you to create main categories with a topic name to add resources to 
* Further organization whithin main categories with the use of sub-categories
* Allows you to search for a specific resource in your library


My goal for now is to make progress in the Odin Project and include interactivity into my website. My first interactivity goal is to create divs with the same styling each time that the "Add resource category" button is clicked.
